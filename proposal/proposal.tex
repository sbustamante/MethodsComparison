\section{Introduction}
%==============================================================================
As we understand more deeply the physical processes involved in astrophysical 
phenomena, it becomes necessary to compute complex interactions of a ever 
increasing number of single components. Some prominent examples include 
the large-scale Universe, galaxy evolution, stellar interior, star formation 
and protoplanetary disk dynamics. A common aspect of these examples is that all 
of them can be regarded basically as a fluid mechanic problem.

\

Although the development of analytical approaches has demonstrated to be a
valuable resource for studying these processes, their increasing complexity 
makes necessary to invoke numerical solutions as a more viable alternative. For
this purpose, two different families of hydrodynamics solvers has been explored
and widely used by the astrophysical community. First, a family of 
moving-mesh-based techniques (e.g. \textit{Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics} 
\SPH\ \citep{Monaghan92}, \textit{Voronoi Particle Hydrodynamics} \VPH\ 
\citep{Hess10}), and a second family of fixed-mesh-based techniques (e.g.
\textit{Adaptive Mesh Refinement} \texttt{AMR} \citep{Berger89}).

\

Due to the Lagrangian character of moving-mesh methods, techniques like \SPH\ 
are easily implemented on a computer. Furthermore, as the physical system 
evolves, the mass particles naturally move into higher density regions, 
providing a self-adjusting spatial resolution. Nevertheless, \SPH\ has been 
shown to produce spurious suppression of fluid instabilities due to its 
kernel-based density estimator, making it unsuitable to model some of the 
dynamics accurately. On the other hand, fixed-mesh methods like \AMR\ are more 
efficient for capturing shock dynamics. However, due to the conservative nature 
of the hydrodynamical equations, a fixed mesh causes a lack of Galilean 
invariance. Furthermore, the sampling of physical properties over the grid 
introduces spurious vorticity to the fluid, making this technique poor suitable 
for studying turbulent flows.

\

A completely new approach to solve hydrodynamical problems was introduced by 
\citet{Springel10} and implemented into the \AREPO\ code. It combines the 
strengths of \AMR\ and \SPH\ but overcomes many of their weaknesses, hence it 
can be though as a mixed technique. \AREPO\ uses a moving mesh based on a 
Voronoi tessellation defined over a set of particles that represents the fluid. 
The geometry of the mesh resembles very closely that of the point distribution,
retaining the self-adaptivity inherent of \SPH\ and also keeping a grid to 
capture shocks like \AMR\ does. These features make \AREPO\ highly accurate for
simulating a wide range of hydrodynamical problems. Nevertheless, there is a 
price to pay for this accuracy, \AREPO\ demands a huge computing time as 
compared with \SPH\ and even \AMR.

\

A very interesting alternative was introduced by \citet{Hess10}, i.e. the 
\textit{Voronoi Particle Hydrodynamics} \VPH\ technique. This approach consists
of an implementation of \SPH\ with a modified density estimator based on the  
\textit{Voronoi Tessellation Field Estimator} \VTFE. The new estimator
has demonstrated to improve substantially the spurious suppression of fluid 
instabilities as well as retaining the computational efficiency of the original 
formulation.

\

Finally, galaxy evolution and large-scale structure formation are very rich 
astrophysical phenomena where a plethora of hydrodynamical processes can be 
found and studied. In this fashion, cosmological simulations are a quite 
suitable scenario for performing detailed physical and computational 
comparisons of all above-mentioned techniques. It is especially interesting to 
quantify the computational efficiency of the \VPH\ technique in terms of its 
physical accuracy as compared with the classical approaches and \AREPO.
